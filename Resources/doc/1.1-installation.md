Installation
============
Use composer to manage your dependencies and download:

    
		"mohebifar/date-time-bundle": "dev-master"
		OR
		"mohebifar/DateTimeBundle": "dev-master"
		
Then update :

    composer update
	
Use composer CLI:

		php composer.phar require mohebifar/DateTimeBundle

Also you can install it using git :

    git clone https://github.com/mohebifar/DateTimeBundle.git

After getting package, you have to include that. Edit `app/AppKernel.php` and add this line in `registerBundles` function :

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
		//...
		
		// active bundle in app/AppKernel
		new Mohebifar\DateTimeBundle\MohebifarDateTimeBundle(),
		)
		
		//..
	}

Edit *app/config/config.yml* as following :
	# Persian date-time-bundle
    mohebifar_date_time:
        driver: Persian
        
And now your calendar service uses persian driver.
